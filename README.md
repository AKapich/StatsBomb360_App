# [StatsBomb360 App for Euro 2024](https://statsbomb360-aleks-kapich.streamlit.app/)
App for analysis of StatsBomb 360Â° data from Euro 2024. The data shared by StatsBomb is a collection of freeze-frames from the matches of the tournament, with every match amassing hundreds of frames.

Currently the tool may be used in two modes: either by choosing particular moment from the match using time slider or by selecting freeze frames for particular shots taken throughout the chosen match. Moreover, it features Voronoi diagrams for match events, visualizing how players manage to control space on the pitch.
